##What is a Coding Dojo?

A coding dojo is meeting where we come together as developers and collectively solve programming problems and challenges. The goal is to share knowledge and problem solving techniques with one another while also potentially exploring new and interesting problem domains.

##Format

We are going to try a new format. We will present a problem and discuss possible strategies for solving that problem. We will than work on the problem as individuals or in small groups. We will than present our solutions.

In the past we have followed this format. 

  * A problem is selected
  * Two people pair program to develop a solution
  * As you work you actively discuss and your thought process and ideas about solving the problem
  * After 10 minutes of work there will be a 5 minute group discussion about the current approach
  * 2 different people will rotate in and continue working on the solution
  * Audience can help and offer insight or advice if required.
  * When a problem is finished we discuss the solution, alternative approaches, and possible flaws / weaknesses
